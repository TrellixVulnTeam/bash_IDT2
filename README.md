#Introduction
These scripts help me setup a new lubuntu (18.10?+) system quickly, and a few other very handy things.

First I copy/paste contents of copy_paste_me.sh into a new script, then chmod +x ./script.sh, then, after setting up ssh keys, I can run ./setup.sh

remember to run :Helptags in vim

##Notes (VIM)
ZZ in normal mode = save and quit
ZQ      ''        = quit without saving
$       ''        = go to end of line
